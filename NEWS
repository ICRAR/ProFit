Latest version is always on GitHub at ICRAR/ProFit. Noted which version is on CRAN.

v1.1.1  Fixed vignettes to not run ProFound (and by proxy EBImage, which is not supported by CRAN now).

v1.1  Added OpenCL support

v1.0  First released on CRAN & GitHub

v1.0.1  Released on GitHub

FEATURE: You can now directly specify the region to use for fitting in profitSetupData (before it always used a combination of segim and mask, which it will use if this is not provided). Old code will work as before. Argument order has changed to accommodate.

CHANGE: profitRemakeModelList -> profitRemakeModellist (to be more consistent with how modellist is named throughout ProFit).

FEATURE: profitRemakeModellist can now take Data as an input for simplicity.

FIXED: Solaris issue with gauss.cpp.

FIXED: profitMakePlots so the region is shown correctly.

v1.0.2 Released on CRAN (latest) & GitHub

CHANGE: Minor internal naming changes.

FIXED: Occassional issue with profitMakePlots failing for certain region over-plots.

FIXED:  Intervals now work properly with the PSF model.

v1.0.3 GitHub only

FEATURE: GPU support via OpenCL (see vignettes).

FEATURE: OpenMP support (see vignettes).

Some minor mixes.

v1.0.4 GitHub only (latest)

FEATURE: A large number of utility functions added to aid in creating inputs for profitSetupData. In particular profitMakeSegim and profitMakeSegimExpand (for segmenting an image and making a segim map, this requires EBImage to be installed), profitSkyEst (for estimating the sky), profitGainEst (for estimating the gain), profitMakeSigma (for making a sigma map), and profitImBlur / profitImGrad / profitImDiff for transforming images. Also profitSkyEstLoc (local sky) and profitMakeSkyMap (coarse sky map generator) and profitMakeSkyGrid (fine sky map generator). Various very short utility functions added.

FEATURE: profitDeprojectImageEllipse for circularising galaxies.

FEATURE: Added new vignettes on making segmentation maps, sigma maps, and the Full Monty of estimating all ProFit inputs from just image pixel data.

FIXED: profitMakeGaussianPSF had a mistake with the fwhm parameter (the radius it created was x2 too big). This was reported by Sarah Casura
