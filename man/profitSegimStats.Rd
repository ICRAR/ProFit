\title{
Image Segmentation Statistics
}
\description{
Basic summary statistics for image segments, e.g. aperture parameters, fluxes and surface brightness estimates. These might provide useful first guesses to ProFit fitting parameters (particularly \option{flux}, \option{axrat} and \option{ang}).
}
\usage{
profitSegimStats(image, segim, sky = 0, skyRMS = 0, magzero = 0, gain, pixscale = 1,
header, sortcol = "segID", decreasing = FALSE, rotstats = FALSE, boundstats = FALSE)
profitSegimPlot(image, segim, mask, sky = 0, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{image}{
Numeric matrix; required, the image we want to analyse.
}
  \item{segim}{
Numeric matrix; required, the segmentation map of the \option{image}. This matrix *must* be the same dimensions as \option{image}.
}
  \item{sky}{
User provided estimate of the absolute sky level. Can be a scalar or a matrix matching the dimensions of \option{image} (allows values to vary per pixel).
}
  \item{skyRMS}{
User provided estimate of the RMS of the sky. Can be a scalar or a matrix matching the dimensions of \option{image} (allows values to vary per pixel).
}
  \item{mask}{
Boolean matrix; optional, non galaxy parts of the \option{image} to mask out, where 1 means mask out and 0 means use for analysis. If provided, this matrix *must* be the same dimensions as \option{image}. 
}
  \item{magzero}{
  Numeric scalar; the magnitude zero point. What this implies depends on the magnitude system being used (e.g. AB or Vega). If provided along with \option{pixscale} then the flux and surface brightness outputs will represent magnitudes and mag/asec^2.
}
  \item{gain}{
Numeric scalar; the gain (in photo-electrons per ADU). This is only used to compute object shot-noise component of the flux error (else this is set to 0).
}
  \item{pixscale}{
  Numeric scalar; the pixel scale, where pixscale=asec/pix (e.g. 0.4 for SDSS). If set to 1 (default), then the output is in terms of pixels, otherwise it is in arcseconds. If provided along with \option{magzero} then the flux and surface brightness outputs will represent magnitudes and mag/asec^2.
}
  \item{rotstats}{
Logical; if TRUE then the \option{asymm}, \option{flux_reflect} and \option{mag_reflect} are computed, else they are set to NA. This is because they are very expensive to compute compared to other photometric properties.
}
  \item{boundstats}{
Logical; if TRUE then various pixel boundary statistics are computed (\option{Nedge}, \option{Nsky}, \option{Nobject}, \option{Nborder}, \option{edge_frac} and \option{edge_excess}). If FALSE these return NA instead (saving computation time).
}
  \item{header}{
Full FITS header in table or vector format. If this is provided then the segmentations statistics table will gain \option{RAcen} and \option{Decen} coordinate outputs. Legal table format headers are provided by the \code{read.fitshdr} function or the \option{hdr} list output of \code{read.fits} in the astro package; the \option{hdr} output of \code{readFITS} in the \code{FITSio} package or the \option{header} output of \code{magcutoutWCS}. Missing header keywords are printed out and other header option arguments are used in these cases. See \code{\link{magWCSxy2radec}}.
}
  \item{sortcol}{
Character; name of the output column that the returned segmentation statistics data.frame should be sorted by. See below for column names and contents.
}
  \item{decreasing}{
Logical; if FALSE (default) the segmentation statistics data.frame will be sorted in increasing order, if TRUE the data.frame will be sorted in decreasing order.
}
  \item{\dots}{
Further arguments to be passed to \code{\link{magimage}}.
}
}
\details{
\code{profitSegimStats} provides summary statistics for the individual segments of the image, e.g. properties of the apertures, and the sum of the flux etc. This is used inside of \code{\link{profitMakeSegim}} and \code{\link{profitMakeSegimExpand}}, but it may be useful to use seperately if manual modifications are made to the segmentation, or two segmentations (e.g. a hot and cold mode segmentation) need to be combined.

The interpretation of some of these outputs will depend a lot on the data being analysed, so it is for the user to decide on sensible next steps (e.g. using the outputs to select stars etc). One output of interest might be \option{flux_reflect}. This attempts to correct for missing flux where segments start colliding. This probably returns an upper limit to the flux since in some regions it can even be double counted if the two sources that have colliding segmentation maps are very close together and similar in brightness, so somewhere between \option{flux} and \option{flux_reflect} the truth probably lies. If you want a better estimate of the flux division then you should really be using the profiling routine of \code{ProFit}.

\code{profitSegimPlot} is useful when you only have a small number of sources (roughly a few hundred). With more than this it can start to take a long time to make the plot!
