libprofit is a low-level C++ library that produces images based on different luminosity profiles.

The currently supports the following profiles:
**sersic**, **coresersic**, **moffat**, **ferrer**, **king**, **brokenexp**, **sky** and **psf**.
With time we intend to add more profiles to the library. Users can also provide their own profiles.

For more information read [libprofit's documentation](https://libprofit.readthedocs.io/).
